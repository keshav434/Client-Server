This readme file will guide you how to run the code and mysql database. I have made database called as Database and network which contains a Pdf of the ER diagram(EER for clients), a SQL Script(CLIENTSS) and a code file (DandN).
Running the mysql script:
1 insert and run the create database clients.
2 insert all the tables except UsersID_Tab tables and run.
3 insert all the records except UserID_Tab's records and run.
4 Insert the UsersID_Tab now and run after the other tables are inserted.
5 Insert the UsersID_Tab's record and run after the other tables records are inserted.

Note: Properties for the mysql workbench "server=localhost, user=root, database= clients, port=3306, password = K.p37883HUSU"
The database is ready now to run through C# now.

You can view the ER diagram by clicking on the Pdf(EER for clients).

TO run the program:
1 Click on DandN.sln from the DandN file, Click run.

Note: LoginID's(1223, 1531, 1276, 1543,1531, 1864, 1355, 1223, 1234, 1229) can be used to run the program.
